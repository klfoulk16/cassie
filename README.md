# Meet Cassie, an baby SSTable Database

Cassie was born out of a desire to do more than just read Designing Data Intensive Applications, but rather to see it live in code. For most of coding career I've worked with Postgres and SQLite, but never really understood what was going on under the hood. While I know that those two databases use B-trees, the SSTable and LSM-tree model seemed much more intrigueing hence I'll be building my database using that structure. Let's get started!

## The Project

### - Memtables using Red Black Trees

### - Log File in Case of Crash

### - Ability to write 

### - A baby SQL-like parser and shell

### - Writing memtable to disk, including sparse index

### - Background Compaction and Merging using Mergesort

## Questions

- How should I have the database to run persitently in the background? Could I use docker? 
- Can I create a simple visualization?
- Is there a simple project I can create to demonstrate a use case?
- What will tests look like? (I'll have to figure this one out pretty quickly)
